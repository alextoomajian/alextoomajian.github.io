    <p>My goal for the final project is to demonstrate my knowledge of internet personal security covered in the course to the best of my ability. I wish to communicate the lessons learned with visual and auditory elements to communicate my points effectively so that any persons viewing my project will be able to grasp the concept with ease.
        <br>At this point my tentative title would be: "Internet Security, Protect your Sanity"
