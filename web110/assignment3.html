    <p>Activity 5: IP addresses and geolocation

        This activity demonstrates and explains how geolocation works in an attempt to map your deviceâ€™s IP to a location. It also has me using websites that can identify my IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
        
        Learning about how geolocation works was interesting to me, as it has always interested or concerned me. Whenever I would visit Google, video streaming websites, or some websites to download foreign videogames, my access would be restricted because of the region that it detected me in. Looking through the Livewire article on Wikiversity explains the method used to tie an IP to a particular region. While it is far from perfect, it does narrow the area enough to determine where the user is connecting from. Knowing how websites can identify your region allows me to use other services like a proxy in order to connect to websites that are restricted, which I find useful.
        
        
        
        
        Activity 3: Documents and Organization
        
        This activity had me looking into ways to manage Windows Explorer in order to manage my PC's filesystem. Firstly, I tried formatting, then adding some files to a USB stick I had. The process is as simple as opening the USB like a folder and placing the files inside. During this lesson, I learned a bit more about shortcuts used in Windows Explorer that allow me to more efficiently manage my files. While Windows Explorer is visually better than the Command Prompt, I find Explorer still gets tripped up trying to move several large files. Knowing both is the key to efficiency.</p>
