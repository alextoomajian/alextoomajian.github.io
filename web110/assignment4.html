        Activity 3: using an email client
        This activity had me learning about the e-mail client Thunderbird. I have not previously used an e-mail client outside of a browser, so I was excited to see what it was capable of. The first thing I noticed was the streamlined setup using both a previous e-mail address I own, as well as creating a new one. Secondly, I had seen the very complete suite of tools availible on the application, including a calender, address book, planner, and the ability to use IRC chat. Pretty much any function I could imagine was included. if there was anything missing, Thunderbird has an easy way to search for and install extensions to compltely customize how you use it. While viewing your email in a browser is functional and simple, manualy updating your contacts and data can eat up hours of time. If I were to use an email client, I would be able to automate many tasks while making viewing my emails more comfortable.
        
        Activity 4: Reading email headers
        Phishing attacks are very common anymore, which is why this activity interested me. Typically I would trust an email from an official email address, not suspecting that it would be spoofed. Going through the article taught me about the history of header spoofing, what it has caused, and how it works. For the exercise I used the Google admin tool to read the header information from an email sent to me. The tool was able to show me detailed information in a presentable form, including the original address, the route it took, and the precise date and time it was sent. Understanding what hackers are able to do in order to get access to your system is extremely important, especially if it is your job. At any point in my life, I could be sent one of these emails asking me for personal information. Being able to identify a spoofed header would save my identity from being stolen.</p>
