    <p>This assignment demonstrated making unordered lists. I had some experience making HTML websites long ago for a game called Neopets. For the assignment, I had made links that would navigate the user to the different assignment pages on my Github repository. This is a good, simple way to refresh myself since I have not used HTML in a long time. After adding the index page to my repository, I was able to verify that all links were functional. Understanding HTML has many uses, whether it be for creating a business or a personal website. The number of ways a website can be formatted anymore is astounding, so keeping up with what has changed has certainly gotten my interest.
