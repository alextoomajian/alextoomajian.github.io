    <p>This project taught me how to organize, plan, and create my own project. I have little experience with creative projects and have enjoyed having the opportunity to use these skills. I learned about the Gantt chart, which allowed me to create a visual timeline of my work and when it should be completed. These skills, I believe, are incredibly useful to anyone in a professional environment, as most work in an IT setting involves good time management. Even coursework requires time management to be successful, which is why it was applied in this lesson.
