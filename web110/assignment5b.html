    <p>Section 5b, Activity 5: Piracy
        This activity described some rules regarding file sharing online. Despite having no value, digital files are still treated as though they do. Downloading or accessing digital files that you do not have the rights to is considered copyright infringement. The article describes some ways some people may unknowingly commit copyright infringement. One of such ways is to download files off of a file-sharing network. It is not often clear on these services which files are copyrighted or which are enforced. Using file sharing services is a great way to preserve and share files, programs, and artwork that would otherwise be inaccessible or lost. It is just as important to know how not to get into trouble with copyright infringement.
