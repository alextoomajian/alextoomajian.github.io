    <p>This assignment was a fun exercise in learning a bit about what SQL can do. For instance, I learned how to query more specific data by selecting more than one field at a time. There are so many ways to use SQL to organize thousands of records to find the exact ones you are looking for. I have used SQL in the past for organizing forum data that was submitted to a website in order to survey customers of a store. This is just one of many uses for SQL I was able to use.</p>
    <ul>A.<br>
        SELECT CustomerName,City FROM Customers;<br>
        B.<br>
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE Country='USA';<br>
        C.<br>
        SELECT COUNT(column_name)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;<br>
        D.<br>
        INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
        VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');<br>
        E.<br>
        UPDATE Customers
        SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
        WHERE CustomerID = 1;</ul>
