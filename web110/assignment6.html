    <p>Session 6 Activities

        2. Review the IP address settings for your local network:
        
        This activity focuses on how to troubleshoot some simple network issues that would prevent your computer from connecting to the network. Though some simple solutions might seem obvious, they usually solve the issue I'm having. For the activity, I tried to review each of the troubleshooting steps on the Microsoft website. Afterwards, I used the ipconfig command in the Microsoft Command Prompt to observe the information about my computerâ€™s network connections. This information is used to connect to the computer using other devices on the network. This lesson is important for managing a home network and your devices. I like to have several devices with various functions that can be accessed remotely in my home, so this information is important to know.
        
        
        4. Share a folder and connect to the shared folder:
        
        This time, the task is to share a folder over a network. This is made very simple by using Windows Explorer, opening the properties of the desired folder, and making the folder accessible to the network. This can be used to keep files available on multiple devices while being able to store them on a separate one. Afterwards, I was able to specify the path of my files and display them on another device. Using the CLI commands, I can achieve the same results: being able to share drives or directories over the network, determining how many simultaneous users are allowed, or removing allowed users. I find that Explorer can take an excessive amount of time to complete simple tasks like sharing folders. That is why I believe that using the command line is a much faster way to share files.
