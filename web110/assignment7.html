        Activity 2: Practice web browser safety.
        
        
        
        
        This activity is an exercise in web browser security. Most people know that not every website is safe or cares for your privacy. Going through the Firefox privacy settings page showed me the different ways the browser can be used and configured to help protect the user’s privacy. Features such as global privacy control that will tell websites you visit not to sell data or a warning if a website has a distrusted certificate. The other listed settings are also of critical importance. Addons you may have unknowingly installed may be sending private data to a third party without your knowledge, so you should only use trustworthy add-ons. Everyone is after your private information anymore; some people don’t care, but if the data is compromised, it may lead to identity fraud, which is a good reason to take privacy seriously.
        
        
        
        
        Activity 3: Use anti-malware software to scan your system and test for malware detection.
        
        
        
        
        Anti-virus programs are important for protecting your computer from harmful files. For this activity, I downloaded malwarebytes and installed them. I performed a full scan on my system and found no threats. I then downloaded the EICAR test file, which should be detected by antivirus software, to test their functionality. After downloading it, it was detected as harmful and requested action. Antivirus software is important for protecting the safety of not only your computer but all computers on your network. Anyone with access to your files could easily use them for any number of malicious crimes. Keeping a secure, updated antivirus is a basic step in internet safety.</p>
