    <p>Section 5, activity 1: social networking
        This activity gave me a brief overview of various social media platforms of the current day. Many of them allow anyone to post messages to anyone in the world. There are some details that set the websites apart, more or less accomplishing the same objective of notifying those who follow you. If I were to choose, I would pick either Line or WhatsApp. Not everyone I know has a working cell number. I don’t have any interest in sharing my messages between strangers, so being able to only share posts between certain people, like a group messenger, works best for my needs.
         
        Activity 2: LinkedIn profile
        This activity had me setting up my own LinkedIn account. I chose this platform for the fact that it is very commonly used in job hiring to collect your information and history. While I’m not interested in their monetization, I recognize that recruiters might not consider an application if they cannot scrape information about you online. I was able to set up an account using my resume, filling in any gaps in the information. I was then able to add skills and job history easily. I may disagree with social media use, but it has become a major part of communication in the world, which is why it will benefit me to learn to use it.
