<p>For the first activity of the lesson, I took time to review the Mozilla article regarding accessibility and what exactly it was. Before this article, I had only thought accessibility referred to people with disabilities. Reviewing the article made it clear to me that the term has a much broader meaning, which includes the accessibility of different devices, browsers, and download speeds. It should be assumed that people with any forseeable disability will visit your webpage at some point, so it is good practice to implement any and all measures to improve their experience. I would say that any and all information in the article regarding accessibility is useful to me since I plan on creating websites in the future. However,Â  one important other point in the article refers to using semantic HTML. This describes the process of properly organizing HTML elements in the page so that webcrawlers and search engines can identify your site clearly and index them accordingly, allowing more relevant traffic to find its way to your page. I found the subject to be very important, and I will attempt to apply lessons learned to all of my future projects as good practice.




    For the second activity, I chose to use the W3 validator to check a random webpage I found online. For the exercise, I used https://thechocolatbar.com/ with the validator. This gave me a descriptive line-by-line analysis of formatting and syntax errors that could be corrected. It is very likely this page was made with an older HTML version in mind. This makes the validator a good tool to refine the page for efficiency and accessibility. I find it difficult to find single-character errors in my pages. The way the validator is able to highlight and give correct examples when pointing out errors I would find invaluble when creating pages, as well as pointing out formatting errors I would not even recognize. This was an interesting educational tool that I will definitely look at whenever creating pages in the future.</p>
