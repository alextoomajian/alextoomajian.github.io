    <p>Activity 2: Installing different web browsers and comparing them.

      I tried using multiple web browsers listed on Wikiversity and installed add-ons. The first browser I used was Firefox, which hosts the most features and extensions of any of the other browsers that I used in the activity. Chrome was second to Firefox in terms of extensions and addons, but Chrome’s options are not as extensive as Firefox's. Edge is the default Windows browser, and I have hardly used it until this exercise. It may be missing some of the features Firefox has, but it has recently added the co-pilot AI assistant, which alternatives lack and is much more useful than Cortana, Microsoft’s previous assistant. Opera made a very bad impression on me from the start. It features a suite of sidebar apps that can be customized, such as WhatsApp. I was annoyed about it’s slow performance on my PC, as well as the aggressive ads and data collection. Brave is a privacy-focused browser that is based on Chromium. It shares the same extensions as Chrome and features a built-in adblocker. My overall impression of using all of them and importing or exporting my preferences from each was that all of the browsers listed on the wikiversity page are all Chromium minus Firefox, with the biggest difference between them being the gadgets on the side.
      
      
      
      
      Activity 5: Configure browser extensions and add-ons
      
      Most of the browsers use Chrome as a foundation, making it similarly simple to add and remove different add-ons and extensions using the browser’s toolbar. Firefox was a little different, but it was still simple and self-explanatory to add and remove extensions. </p>
