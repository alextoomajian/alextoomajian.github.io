<p>For the activity this week, I studied the Bureau of Labor Statistics website for details on computer networking careers. Generally, computer network engineers earn a salary of about $128,000 and require five years of related experience. Some positions may require a bachelor's degree; others may require a master's degree in computer information technology. The employment rate stated on the webpage states that, as with all computer-related jobs, network engineers also rise in demand as companies require more computer-related infrastructure. Compared to the rate of pay of other careers in the field, other careers, such as database administrators or programmers, offer less pay, but they do grant the necessary experience to obtain the position of network architect.</p>
